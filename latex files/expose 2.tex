Thesis Expose

TO DO:

- Persona dataset - refer to paper (describe what the dataset is)
- Conv.ai - describe challenge, put link
				- check best result and how they achieved them (papers)

				
- Look at baseline models from different papers for conversational models
	- check dataset and content 
	
- Look into seq2seq and Key-Value Profile Memory (Good enough for Prof. for now)


Check TransferTransfo paper
1. Maybe: Combine Transfer learning method used here with KV Profile Memory network
		- Not sure but I think in the paper they only used a generative model, not a ranking model
		- Maybe pretraining on a dataset would improve the way KV attention model gets its output
		- Check if memory augmentation was incorporated in the paper if not, this would be good start

2. Find better way to use Key-Value Memory:
		- Think in paper, they have used sentence embedding, so try using word embedding or combining this with HRED method or something
		
3. Try to make the KV model a Generative model or try to improve it:
		-e.g. Make a model that uses KV model to first outputs a value and use this output as an input to a generative model...
		

Others:
- Memory Augmented Neural Networks

Challenges:
- How to get the additional info from the newly created database into the network


If using Fabian's db:
- Check if better/more labeling improves result

- How does KV Prof. Memory perform if in addition to the input sentences, there are additionally attitudes linked to the input
